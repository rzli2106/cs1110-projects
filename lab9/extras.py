Additional problems for more practice

This problem is taken from an old exam.  To get the proper "exam experience" you 
should complete the Vector2 functions without any method calls.

    Changes the vector v into a unit vector in the same direction.
    
    This function is a procedure.  It does not return a new vector.
    It modifies the x and y attributes of the parameter v.  If v is a
    zero vector, the function leaves it unchanged.
    
    Parameter v: the vector to normalize
    Preconditions: v is a Vector2 object

    length = math.sqrt((v.x * v.x) + (v.y * v.y))

        v.x = v.x / length
        v.y = v.y / length


def project(u,v):
    """
    Returns the projection of u onto v.
    
    This function returns a new vector and does not modify either u or v.  If v is 
    the zero vector, then it returns a new zero vector.
    
    
    Parameter u: the vector to project
